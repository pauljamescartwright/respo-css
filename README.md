###Respo-CSS
****
####Respo-CSS is a CSS template for creating a responsive web site.
To use this tool I would suggest clicking download zip(on the right-hand side of the page) that should download the repository.  Then copy the index.html and css folder to your development directory and read all the comments and your running.  However if you already have a site started then copy the meta and link tags out of the index.html and put them in all of your files, also put the responsive.css in where ever you put your css, make sure you update the link tags to the real locations of the css files.
