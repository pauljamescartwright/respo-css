###Respo-CSS
****
####Respo-CSS is a CSS template for creating a responsive web site.
To use this tool I would suggest installing git, [Click Here!](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#Installing-on-Linux) for instructions for linux, for macintosh [Click Here!](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#Installing-on-Mac) for windows I sugest [GitHub](http://windows.github.com/) which is a grafical user interface for git click download and then install it.  Then in linux and mac open up the terminal and create a new folder.  Then go into it and run

`git clone https://github.com/pauljamescartwright/respo-css.git`

that should download the repository.  Then copy the index.html and css folder to your development directory and read all the comments and your running.  However if you already have a site started then copy the meta and link tags out of the index.html and put them in all of your files, also put the responsive.css in where ever you put your css, make sure you update the link tags to the real locations of your css files.
