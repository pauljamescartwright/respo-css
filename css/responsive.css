Below this is where all the styles that are diffrent based on page size,
that is done via @media.  All the css that is the same no matter the screen size
goes in the other css file (base.css).

/*
To make your page's responsiveness look better, you should set custom min-widths.
To set the min-width you need to have a away of figuring out the width (in pixels)
of the page as you move one edge of your browser window left and right.
I would suggest a chrome extention called Window Resizer at
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh?hl=en
it shows viewport size as you move the edge of the page around.
Then find the viewport size that your page looks broken at (starting from the
smallest and working your way up) then set the min-width to the size right
before it looks broken.  Then change the media qwery with the min-width larger
and write some css to make it look un-broken.  Repeat untill it looks good at every
viewport size, and copy and paste the individual media qweries to make as many as you need,
then get rid of this great big comment!
